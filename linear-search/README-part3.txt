Output for given source code for Lab #1:

Before: 4 5 2 7
Entering swapAll: 4 5 2 7
Leaving swapAll: 2 7 4 5
After: 4 5 4 5


Description:
Initially the int variables a and b were assigned 4 and 5 respectively and the variable of type Pair called pair calls the constructor given the int parameters 2 and 7. The printAll method is then called which prints out the given parameters in a specific format. The swapAll method is then called with the given parameters, which simply swaps the variables a and b with the variables a and b in the Pair object called pair. The actual method prints out the integers before the swap and after the swap.
